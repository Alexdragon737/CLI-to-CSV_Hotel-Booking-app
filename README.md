# About the program
This is a program that aims to simplify the process of adding booking entries for a hotel.<br>
CSV files are used for the simplicity of working with them, even though the options are limited when it comes to formatting, compared to XLS/XLSX files. 



## To be added: 
The current state of the program: work in progress. As of right now, I want to develop these basic features:
- removing an entry from the table by only specifying the entry ID to be removed
- exporting the bookings file in other formats than CSV in order to allow for better formatting.
